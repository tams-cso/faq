# Is there any kind of preparation we need to do?
Although TAMS says the CS track is for those with prior programming
experience, the computer science classes do not have any prerequisites
and are designed for those without prior programming experience.

# What language will we use?
The classes are taught in C++. If you've only ever programmed in
high-level languages like Java or Python before, it will be lower-level
than what you are used to, but nothing you can't handle :)

# What about operating systems?
Anything works fine, though Windows users may find a UNIX terminal
emulation layer such as [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org) helpful to
run Linux programs (e.g. the `vimtutor` command below).

# Is there a recommended text editor?
You will have to learn a command-line editor to use on lab exams; we
recommend Vim for this. Its basics can be learned in half an hour by
typing `vimtutor` in your terminal. For general-purpose use Visual
Studio Code is a lightweight yet feature-rich editor and CLion is an
advanced IDE available with the [Github Student Developer Pack]
(https://education.github.com/pack).

# What is your setup like?
If you want to know what terminal color scheme or Vim plugins we use,
you can look under our [Github accounts]
(https://github.com/orgs/tams-cso/people).

# Any recommendations for electives?
If you plan to pursue CS as a major, higher-level math courses will be
more helpful and more likely to be accepted as credits than UNT's CS
courses. Popular choices for second semester include linear algebra and
discrete math.

# Should I get specific hardware?
Unless you already plan on doing computationally expensive tasks, you do
not need any specialized hardware. For the average user, a Core i5/Ryzen
5 CPU, 8 GB RAM, a 256 GB solid state drive, and a 1080p display should
be plenty.

# Any other tips?
Please don't procrastinate on homework unless you want to get
traumatized from trying to write thousands of lines in one week. Just
ask any of the seniors.
